# ControllerTweaks
This mod is a collection of 3 controller related tweaks:
1) Controller Swap: Swap the sabers on the left and right controllers so you can hold the left controller in right hand and vice versa. Allows for swap grips which are useful alternative grips for competitive play. Accessible from the modifiers menu under "MODS" as shown in the screenshot below.

2) Oculus VR Remap: Allows you to remap the pause and select/trigger buttons on the PCVR Oculus version of the game or ``-vrmode oculus`` on Steam. **Make sure** if you remap the pause button to one of the triggers you also remap the corrosponding select button to something else.

3) Controller Offset Tweaks: Controller Offset is now accessible from the modifiers menu, you can change it right before going into a song, or better yet while playing a song in practice mode so you can practice your swings and adjust your offset!

You can even create your own presets (the create button is **only available from the modifiers menu** and not pause) as well as load from or save to presets. You can also make the offset apply after a small delay so you don't have to deal with your controllers moving around as you adjust the slider. This is accessible from the settings button which is next to the presets button.
